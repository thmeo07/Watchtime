## It is **not a streaming platform**. EHSAAN PLAY is a personal library for discovering, organizing, rating, and keeping track of movies and TV series.

---

### 🔒 Your data stays yours

EHSAAN PLAY does not require an account or personal cloud database for your library.

Personal data is stored locally in your browser/device.

---

## 🖼️ Smart Artwork Storage

Large movie libraries can become surprisingly heavy when posters and backdrops are permanently stored on the device.

EHSAAN PLAY therefore separates:

**Personal Data**

from

**TMDB Artwork**

Artwork can be fetched from TMDB when needed and handled through browser caching rather than unnecessarily storing large image files inside your personal library data.

This keeps your actual library data lightweight even when your collection grows significantly.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

EHSAAN PLAY follows the EHSAAN design philosophy:

> **Make useful things. Make them feel good to use.**

The interface focuses on:

* Calm visual hierarchy
* Minimal controls
* Comfortable spacing
* Clean typography
* Subtle interactions
* Personal customization
* Dark and light themes
* A distraction-free browsing experience

No unnecessary dashboards.

No complicated menus.

Just your library.
